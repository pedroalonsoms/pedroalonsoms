## About me ideas

- I was born in the city of Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico in the year 2003.
  -At the age of 2 I moved to the city of Los Mochis, Sinaloa.
- I was exposed to technology very early in my life.
- Since I was a child I started playing computer videogames (such as Minecraft).
- I helped at my mom’s furniture business by helping them repair the computers when they broke up (the guys at the iT department called me to help them)
- I’ve dreamed on having my own pc that I even made paper-computers at my mom’s job.
- My first computer was a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro
- In junior-high school I started developing a curiosity for hacking.
- I taught myself hacking skills by following YouTube tutorials
- I got an iPod 4, when I was in elementary school, so I started investigating how to hack it for various purposes such as hacking video games and installing themes on iOS (I remember at that time the Cydia app was very popular & the jailbreak stuff)
- I remember in school all of my friends were surprised when I got 99999+ coins at SubwaySurfers
- I wanted to hack wifi (we didn’t had internet at grandma’s house at the time), so I discovered that in order to hack Wi-Fi you had to use this tool called WiFislax (which was linux based), then I unconsciously started learining linux
- Then I got curious about other operating systems and I remember using USB’s pendrives to install Metasploit, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, etc by following YouTube tutorials
- As the time went on, I was very knowledgeable for being the tech person at the family so when the printer went down, or someone had a problem with their phone they went straight to me to fix it.
- When I was in high school I moved back to Culiacan to live with my grandmother and study in Tecnológico de Monterrey (PrepaTec).
- In high school I got exposed to basic programming in C/C++ and specially to the Arduino ecosystem
- It was pretty clear to me that I wanted to study something related to computers
- In order to apply to scholarships I developed my first website, called SinaloaCovidApp, for which I had to teach me basic web skills (such as html, css and JS), that was the time where I fell in love with web technologies. I ended up in the top 500 finalists.
- As my project was related to social impact, I got congratulated by my school and the municipal president.
- It was also in high school when I got curious about mobile development, so that’s also the time when I tried a lot of mobile frameworks (like react native, flutter, native development, etc)
- When I got into college, I moved to Monterrey to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Tecnológico de Monterey, where I’ve met several of my best friends and developed numerous projects
- After months of leet-coding I got my first internship at Oracle in my 7th semester, when I moved to Guadalajara, Mexico to visit their offices during 6motnths
